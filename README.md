## Description

A demo for parameterizing Playwright test data using a JSON file.

## How to Install and Configure the Project

### First-time setup

- Clone this repository to your desired workspace.
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Install Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install`
- To confirm successful setup, run the sample tests: `npx playwright test`
- After tests finish, the console output will summarize the results.
- The `playwright-report` and `test-results` folders contain HTML and JSON reports of test results. These results are overwritten with each test run, so make sure to back up any results you wish to keep for reference.
